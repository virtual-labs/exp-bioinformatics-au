### Procedure

The basic bioinformatics user interface helps users learn the essential algorithms used in bioinformatics. The steps to use the simulator are as follows:
1.	Open the simulator window

  <br>
  <img src="images/p5.png" title="" />
  
  i.	The user could see a new page for Brute Force Algorithm with a “Back” button to go to the previous menu.  Now click on “Upload the FASTA file” and load the nucleotide/ amino acid file in FASTA format

  <br>
  <img src="images/p8.png" title="" />
      
  ii.	Click on “Upload the FASTA file to compare” and load the corresponding file (If the first file was a nucleotide file, this should also be a nucleotide file and vice-versa) to compare

  iii.	Click on “Compare”
      
  <br>
  <img src="images/p11.png" title="" />
  
  iv.	Result specifying if the sequence is a match or not will be displayed

  b.	Click on “Dot plot” and click “Submit”
  
  <br>
  <img src="images/p14.png" title="" />
   
  i.	The user could see a new page for Dot Plot with a “Back” button to go to the previous menu.  Now click on “Upload 1st sequence” and load the nucleotide/ amino acid file in FASTA format
      
  <img src="images/p15.png" title="" /> 
  <br>
  <img src="images/p16.png" title="" />
      
      
  ii.	Click on “Upload 2nd sequence” and load the corresponding file (If the first file was a nucleotide file, this should also be a nucleotide file and vice-versa) to compare
      
  <img src="images/p17.png" title="" /> 
     
  iii.	Click on “Plot”
      
  <img src="images/p18.png" title="" />
      
  iv.	A dot plot will be visible with dots at the matched characters (better understandable with a smaller sequence of 10-20 characters)

  c.	Click on “Needlemann-Wunsch” and click “Submit”
  
  <img src="images/p20.png" title="" />
  
  i.	The user could see a new page for Needlemann Wunsch algorithm with a “Back” button to go to the previous menu.  Now click on “Upload a FASTA sequence” and load the nucleotide/ amino acid file in FASTA format
      
  <img src="images/p21.png" title="" /> 
  <br>
  <img src="images/p22.png" title="" />
      
  ii.	Click on “Upload a FASTA sequence to compare” and load the corresponding file (If the first file was a nucleotide file, this should also be a nucleotide file and vice-versa) to compare
      
  <img src="images/p23.png" title="" /> 
     
      
  iii.	Click on “Compare”
      
  <img src="images/p24.png" title="" /> 
      
      
  iv.	Result part is represented in different steps which follow one after the other. 
  
  1.	First step is Initialisation- Click on the “Initialisation” button which displays the initialization matrix and the following button pops up.

  <img src="images/p26.png" title="" />
          
  2.	Second step is the Filling of the matrix- Click on the “Filled matrix” button which displays the values filled after applying the scoring function. and the following button pops up.

  3.	Third step is Traceback- Click on the “Trace Back” button which displays all possible alignment paths of the given sequences, and the following button pops up.

  4.	Fourth step is Displaying an alignment- Click on the “Alignment” button which displays one of the alignment and its alignment score
